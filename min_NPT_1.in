Initial minimization under NPT conditions with restraints
&cntrl
  imin = 1,            ! Perform minimization
  maxcyc = 10000,      ! Maximum number of cycles
  ncyc = 5000,         ! Number of cycles of steepest descent followed by conjugate gradient
  ntb = 2,             ! Constant pressure (NPT)
  ntp = 1,             ! Isotropic pressure coupling
  pres0 = 1.0,         ! Target pressure (1 atm)
  taup = 2.0,          ! Pressure relaxation time (ps)
  ntt = 3,             ! Langevin thermostat
  temp0 = 300.0,       ! Target temperature (300 K)
  gamma_ln = 5.0,      ! Collision frequency for Langevin dynamics (5 ps^-1)
  barostat = 2,        ! Berendsen barostat
  cut = 10.0,          ! Nonbonded cutoff (Å)
  ntr = 1,             ! Turn on restraints
  restraint_wt = 50.0, ! Restraint weight (kcal/mol·Å²)
  restraintmask = ':1-6', ! Apply restraints to the DNA residues 1 to 6

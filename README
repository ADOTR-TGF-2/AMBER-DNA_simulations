Step 1:
Prepare and solvate the dna 
-run the dna pdb file through ambers pdb file tool
-create leap input file called solvate_dna.in

    # Source the AMBER force field for DNA
    source leaprc.DNA.bsc1

    # Source the TIP3P water model
    source leaprc.water.tip3p

    # Load the DNA structure from the PDB file
    dna = loadPDB "1bna_amber.pdb"

    # Solvate the DNA in a rectangular box with specified dimensions
    solvateBox dna TIP3PBOX {49.2 49.7 72.7}

    # Add potassium ions (K+) to neutralize the system automatically
    addIonsRand dna K+ 0

    # Save the AMBER parameter/topology file
    saveAmberParm dna dna_bsc1.prmtop dna_bsc1.inpcrd

    # Save the solvated structure as a PDB file
    savePDB dna dna_solvated_bsc1.pdb

    # Quit tleap
    quit

-run the leap input file
$ tleap -f solvate_dna.in
*** The following info and more can be found in leap.log: 
22 K+ ions added to the system. Leap added 432 missing atoms according to residue templates: 432 H / lone pairs
Volume: 3428508.064 A^3 ; Total mass 1863242.828 amu ; Density 0.902 g/cc ***

Step 2:
run two Minimization runs: Relax the water molecules around the Solute (DNA) with the DNA position restricted followed by the same run but with the DNA unrestricted.
First run:

3. Berendson barostat
4. Langevin thermostat with collision frequency of 5/ps
5. harmonic position restraints of 50kcal/mol/A^2 on DNA atoms

ntp = 1: Specifies isotropic pressure coupling.

Pressure and Temperature:
pres0 = 1.0: Sets the target pressure to 1 atm.
temp0 = 300.0: Sets the target temperature to 300 K.

Barostat:
barostat = 2: Uses the Berendsen barostat for pressure control.

Thermostat:
ntt = 3: Uses the Langevin thermostat.
gamma_ln = 5.0: Sets the collision frequency for the Langevin thermostat to 5 ps^-1.

Harmonic Position Restraints:
ntr = 1: Turns on positional restraints.
restraint_wt = 50.0: Sets the restraint weight to 50 kcal/mol·Å².
restraintmask = ':1-6': Applies the restraints to DNA residues 1 to 6.

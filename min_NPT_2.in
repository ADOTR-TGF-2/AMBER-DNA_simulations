 imin = 1,            ! Perform minimization
 maxcyc = 10000,      ! Maximum number of cycles
 ncyc = 5000,         ! Number of cycles of steepest descent followed by conjugate gradient
 ntb = 2,             ! Constant pressure (NPT)
 ntp = 1,             ! Isotropic pressure coupling
 pres0 = 1.0,         ! Target pressure (1 atm)
 taup = 2.0,          ! Pressure relaxation time (ps)
 ntt = 3,             ! Langevin thermostat
 temp0 = 300.0,       ! Target temperature (300 K)
 gamma_ln = 5.0,      ! Collision frequency for Langevin dynamics (5 ps^-1)
 barostat = 2,        ! Berendsen barostat
 cut = 10.0           ! Nonbonded cutoff (Ã…)
